I will do a review on LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga. I wishlisted the PC version on Steam. I have a copy of the Xbox 360 version.

Here is my plan for the video review:
1. I will write a script on LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga and rewatch the Star Wars films
2. I will play LEGO Star Wars The Complete Saga. Hopefully, I have a friend to help me out with the coop sections.
3. I will edit the video
4. I will release it. I do not have the date of when the video will be released. I think there will be a lot to cover in this video.
